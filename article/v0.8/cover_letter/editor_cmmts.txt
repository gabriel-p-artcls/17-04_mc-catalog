From an editorial point of view - I do notice that you have used a lot of
footnotes. I think that many of these actually belong in the text itself,
because the information is actually necessary, not additional. You make people
do a lot of extra work to find so many footnotes.

1- put information only in main text (not as footnote): 12 ,13, 14, 16, 18, 19,
20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 39
and for footnotes 1, 17 - just put the web address in the footnote (ie. put the
description in the main text) otherwise the main text is not quite clear.

2- Please also check that you reference proposal IDs correctly. I know ESO asks
for this (either as a footnote to the paper title or in the acknowledgements).
It might be that other observatories also would like you to do this, or in some
way acknowledge use of their facilities.
